# Face_Recognition_Attendance_Management_System
Welcome to the Face Recognition Attendance Management System repository! ðŸ“¸âœ…  

My name is Aashvitt Singh. This project is an advanced solution for efficient and accurate attendance management using state-of-the-art facial recognition technology. By leveraging the power of computer vision and machine learning, our system automates the attendance tracking process, eliminating the need for manual data entry and minimizing errors.

## Installation :key:
-----------------------------------

#### Download or Clone the project

First Download or Clone the Project on Your Local Machine.To download the project from github press **Download Zip**

or 

You can clone the project with git bash.To clone the project using git bash first open the git bash and write the following code
```
git clone https://github.com/kmhmubin/Face-Recognition-Attendance-System.git
```

After download, Open the project using **Pycharm or VSCODE**. Then we have to create an python enviroment to run the program.

#### create enviroment 
First open the terminal or command line in the IDE.Then write the following code.
```
python -m venv env
```
Then activate the enviroment using the code below for windows.
```
.\env\Scripts\activate
```
[ *Notice:*
If your pc don't have virtual enviroment or pip install the follow this link.
[How to create Virtual Enviroment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) ]

#### Installing the packages
--------------------------------------------------

After creating the enviroment on your project let's install the necessary packages. 
To install those package open the terminal or command line and paste the code from below

```
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```
```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip install pandas
```
```
pip install Pillow
```
```
pip install pytest-shutil
```
```
pip install python-csv
```
```
pip install yagmail
```

[ **Notice: During the package installization, sometime it shows some error, to avoid those error you can install those packages as admin. ]

## Test Run :bicyclist:
-----------------------
After creating the enviroment and installing the packages, open the IDE terminal/command line to run the program. Using the code below.

```
py main.py
```


## How To Use? :pencil:
----------------------
If you want to use it just follow the steps below.

1. First download or clone the project
